<strong>
  Tasks
</strong>

Build a small web app that will find the cheapest flights around Europe.
The webapp needs to have at least the following components:

<strong>
  Styling
</strong>

Apply a styleguide following the Ryanair branding ( colors )

<strong>
  Components
</strong>

<strong>
  AirportSelector
</strong>

An airport selector which will display the list of airports and allow the user
to select an aiport.

Keep in mind that origin is different from destination but the component needs to
be reusable for both scenarios.

The component needs to be a custom select with autocomplete support.

<strong>
  Flight List
</strong>

A component that will show all the information relative to the flights between the
origin and destination selected.


Extra points will be given for:

* Styling
* Mobile first design
* No third party libraries

<strong>
  Services
</strong>

In order to get the list of IATA codes ( airport codes )  with the relative destinations
the webapp will get those information from the following API:

```
https://murmuring-ocean-10826.herokuapp.com/en/api/2/forms/flight-booking-selector/
```

Instead to get the list of cheap flights:

```
https://murmuring-ocean-10826.herokuapp.com/en/api/2/flights/from/DUB/to/STN/2014-12-02/2015-02-02/250/unique/?limit=15&offset-0
```

where DUBis the originating IATA code, STNis the destination IATA code,
the first date range is the start of the period, and the second is the end.
